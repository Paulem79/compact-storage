# Compact Storage for Minecraft Forge 1.19
Welcome to the new version of Compact Storage, here for Forge 1.19! This update is primarily focused
on brining the mod up to the latest version of Minecraft with no features added. This also focuses on creating feature parity
between the Forge and Fabric versions of the mod.

You can find the mod on [Curse Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compactstorage) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/compact_storage)
